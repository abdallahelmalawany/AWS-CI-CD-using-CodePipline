ðŸš€ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and CI/CD best practices on AWS. The infrastructure, including networking, security, and compute resources, is provisioned using AWS CLI bash scripts. A simple .NET Core web service is automatically built, tested, and deployed whenever changes are pushed to the main branch of the GitHub repository.
